## Greetings, Esteemed Master Jedi. I am Seamus Beecher, Knight of the Code Order. 🚀

Welcome to this sanctum within the GitHub Galaxy, where the Force and code intertwine in mysterious ways. As a humble Front-end Developer/IT Technician hailing from North Carolina, I have devoted myself to mastering the digital arts, seeking to bring balance to the binary forces that govern our realm.

## Current Mission Briefing 🛰️

- 🚀 Engaged in a perpetual battle against bugs and the dark side on quotematrix.app
- 💡 Delving deeper into the Force's secrets within Angular.
- 🌱 Expanding my knowledge through the ancient texts of code in PrimeNG.
- 💬 I eagerly anticipate discussing the arcane mysteries of the Force and the nuances of code with a fellow Master.

## Communicate with Me, Master Jedi 🌟

- 📫 Send your message via the Force: seamusbeecher@hotmail.com
- 🌌 Join me on my journey through the GitHub Galaxy: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seamusbeecher/)
- 😄 May the Force guide our paths.
- ⚡ Fun Fact: My loyal dachshund's name is named after Jar Jar Binks! 🤖

  Yep, you read that right! I named my furry friend after the one and only Jar Jar Binks. I figured if I can handle the most polarizing character in the galaxy, I can handle anything! 🙈


## My Jedi Stats 📊 
Well, it seems my Jedi title might be in jeopardy after looking at these stats. If my lightsaber skills were as rusty as my GitHub contributions, they'd revoke my Jedi status faster than you can say "May the Force be with you"! 🤣
